\section{Part 1}
The development of modern physics is deeply rooted in several landmark discoveries.
Einstein's analysis of Brownian motion provided one of the earliest quantitative
confirmations of the atomic theory \cite{einstein1905brownian}. A few decades later,
the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA revolutionized biology and paved
the way for molecular genetics \cite{crick1953structure}. Meanwhile, major advances
in cosmology and theoretical physics were popularized through works such as
Hawking's treatment of black holes and the nature of time \cite{hawking1988brief}.
Foundational treatments of classical and quantum physics also emerged during this
period, with the \textit{Feynman Lectures on Physics} becoming a central educational
resource for generations of scientists \cite{feynman1963lectures}.
